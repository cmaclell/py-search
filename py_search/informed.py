    beam search and breadth-first beam search. According to:

        Wilt, C. M., Thayer, J. T., & Ruml, W. (2010). A comparison of
        greedy search algorithms. In Third Annual Symposium on Combinatorial
        Search.

    breadth-first beam search almost always performs better. They find that
    allowing the search to re-expand duplicate nodes if they have a lower cost
    improves search performance. Thus, our implementation is a breadth-first
    beam search that re-expand duplicate nodes with lower cost.
